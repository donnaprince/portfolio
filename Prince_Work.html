    Currently, I work at my local 
    <a href="https://www.kumon.com/pleasanton-north-ca" target="_blank">Kumon Math and Reading Center</a>,
    where I am employed as a Kumon Assistant. It has been my pleasure, to have been 
    working in the center from September 2018, till now. Some of the tasks,
    I do include helping students with their math and reading, by providing 
    answers to their questions. In addition, I also correct children’s work
    for accuracy and neatness. Lastly, I also play the role of a team member,
    to many of the co-workers at the center. Over this time period, I have
    been able to create many bonds with the members of the center. Skills,
    that I have obtained from being in a paid position include: interacting 
    with clients (children), arriving in a timely manner, and communicating
    with my Kumon Staff. Interacting with young children has always been a 
    joy for me. This experience allowed me to once more, enter the mindset of 
    young children, to help them in their academic endeavors. Arriving in a
    timely manner is one of the most important aspects of holding a job. 
    Through this job, I have learned the importance of timekeeping, as one's
    lateness, greatly affects the dynamics of how others are able to complete 
    their tasks. Since the center, works collaboratively, I have made it my
    priority to ensure, that I completed each of my shifts, with the highest
    quality I can provide. Upon meeting with one of my managers, she has 
    complimented me about my ability to correct children’s classwork and
    excellent pace. Overall, working at Kumon has allowed to me to develop the skills
    needed in the work force.

   As a Junior a part of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, I took part in
      the Dublin Engineering Mentorship Program. The program consists of weekly 
      check-ins, and a once a month meeting with our mentors. In this program, I 
      was paired up with Jayati Sengupta, Chief of Product and Marketing at CareerWaze,
      an AI-driven Edtech startup here in the Bay Area. Her career has spanned executive
      roles in both Engineering and Product Management as well as Marketing (Business)
      in the tech industry. She has also been a mentor for two years, mentoring Dublin 
      Engineering and Design Academy students. The main objective of the program was
      to ensure that we would be prepared for the college application process, as well
      as develop skills that are essential to the workforce. Some of the skills we 
      focused on during that journey were networking, how to communicate effectively
      through emails, developing an online portfolio, college application process, and
      how to set realistic goals for the future. In the mentorship process, we also faced
      a mock interview to prepare for the interviews we would face in the upcoming years.
      Another activity we participated in was career round robins, where we were able to 
      engage with various mentors to ask about their career paths and expertise. Through
      the mentorship program, I was able to learn more about the various career options 
      and skills that are needed to be a capable worker in the workforce. Aside, from
      this, I was also able to create a good bond with my mentor, Jayati, who has guided
      me in the college application process and has helped me understand what to 
      anticipate of the workforce.
