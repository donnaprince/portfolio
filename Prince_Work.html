    Currently, I work at my local 
    <a href="https://www.kumon.com/pleasanton-north-ca" target="_blank">Kumon Math and Reading Center</a>, 
      where I am employed as a Kumon Grader. It has been my pleasure to have been working in the center 
      from August 2018, till now. Some of the tasks I do include helping students with their math and
      reading, by providing answers to their questions. In addition, I also correct children’s work for 
      accuracy and neatness. Lastly, I also play the role of a team member, to many of the co-workers 
      at the center. Over this time period, I have been able to create many bonds with the members of the 
      center. Skills that I have obtained from being in a paid position include: interacting with clients
      (children), arriving in a timely manner, and communicating with my Kumon Staff. Interacting with 
      young children has always been a joy for me. This experience allowed me to once more, enter the 
      mindset of young children, to help them in their academic endeavors. Arriving in a timely manner 
      is one of the most important aspects of holding a job. Through this job, I have learned the
      importance of timekeeping, as one's lateness, greatly affects the dynamics of how others are able
      to complete their tasks. Since the center works collaboratively, I have made it my priority to 
      ensure that I completed each of my shifts, with the highest quality I can provide. Upon meeting 
      with one of my managers, she has complimented me about my ability to correct children’s classwork
      and excellent pace. Overall, working at Kumon has allowed me to develop the skills needed in the workforce.

    I am also a part of the Dublin Freshman Mentorship Program, which helps incoming 
      Freshman adapt to the high school rigor and style. The mentorship program 
      requires a commitment of 20 minutes every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, along
      with meeting twice a month on Wednesday. When meeting the Freshman three times
      a week, as a mentorship we hold the responsibility of ensuring that they can 
      adapt to the new conditions, and are not falling behind in any situation. Our 
      mentorship program allows us to interact with a group of 20-25 Freshmen, along
      with a teacher who serves as the overall advisor. Through this program, I was
      able to interact with new students, who I would not have been able to create 
      a bond with outside this program. As a large group, all the mentors would also
      meet once a month, and learn about various strategies on how to engage with the 
      Freshman, and ensure that the program would be beneficial to them. We would also
      have a meeting with our advisor every month to improve the program in a small 
      atmosphere. This year we focused on making sure that all the Freshmen were 
      welcomed, and have a mentor that they are comfortable talking with about various 
      subjects.
