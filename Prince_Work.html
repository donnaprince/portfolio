    Currently, I work at my local 
    <a href="https://www.kumon.com/pleasanton-north-ca" target="_blank">Kumon Math and Reading Center</a>,
      a volunteering team. Out of over 200 applicants, I was selected to be a volunteer during the 2019 
      summer, in the Ingenuity Challenges section of the hall. As a volunteer in this section, I was
      expected to foster an interest in STEM fields for our various visitors and engage them in an 
      iterative engineering design process. Some of the activities that I explained about was creating
      a prosthetic hand, pinball machines, and marble machines. For the prosthetic hand portion, 
      I would help young visitors to create a prosthetic hand using, string, cardboard, and pipe 
      cleaners. For the next two units of marble machines and pinball machines, I would engage with 
      young visitors and parents to create machines using recycled materials. During this experience 
      interacting with young students was very exciting listening to their problems, and observing how
      they would change. During my 2019 summer at the Hall, I accumulated a total of 33 hours, over 3
      months. Next, I will be going back next year as an intern, in the Ingenuity Challenges section for 
      the summer of 2020.

    I am also a part of the Dublin Freshman Mentorship Program, which helps incoming 
      Freshman adapt to the high school rigor and style. The mentorship program 
      requires a commitment of 20 minutes every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, along
      with meeting twice a month on Wednesday. When meeting the Freshman three times
      a week, as a mentorship we hold the responsibility of ensuring that they can 
      adapt to the new conditions, and are not falling behind in any situation. Our 
      mentorship program allows us to interact with a group of 20-25 Freshmen, along
      with a teacher who serves as the overall advisor. Through this program, I was
      able to interact with new students, who I would not have been able to create 
      a bond with outside this program. As a large group, all the mentors would also
      meet once a month, and learn about various strategies on how to engage with the 
      Freshman, and ensure that the program would be beneficial to them. We would also
      have a meeting with our advisor every month to improve the program in a small 
      atmosphere. This year we focused on making sure that all the Freshmen were 
      welcomed, and have a mentor that they are comfortable talking with about various 
      subjects.
