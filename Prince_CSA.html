        This project was the first project of the year, which made us utilize programming basics, 
        we gained throughout the summer by watching Youtube videos about Java programming 
        (topics include: Java syntax, loops, arrays, object-oriented programming, inheritance, 
        condition statements). The main objective of this project was to create a seating chart for 
        our class. The client of the project would be our teacher as it served as a way to check where
         the student sat, how to pronounce the students' names, and interact with the student via a 
         question and answer section. No written documentation was done for this project. Instead, a
         ll of the code that was written, had Java documentation, if other students wanted to understand our code. 
         The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQiVuRnMOcAn0zqmiwUv7ni9cedQSMjgcTmc7ZA9d3A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>, 
         used for this project mainly focused on individual aspects we needed to complete such as having our picture in the correct location that 
         corresponded to where we sat, having an animation when our image was clicked, having a sound byte for the teacher to remember our name 
         pronunciation, etc. One skill acquired from the project was reinforcing my knowledge about the basics of programming, 
         as this was my first time programming in Java. Another strength, which I was able to garner was learning that 
         it was essential to communicate with my peers. Even though the project was individual, we all had to push to 
         one Git Repository and ensure that we were in the right location, before pushing our code. The Git Master 
         (person in charge of merging all our code), coordinated everyone's code and was able to finalize the seating 
         chart. Through this project, I was able to create a place in the seating chart, that corresponds to where 
         I sat, that met all the requirements, and more as I also completed the extra credit. Above, is the video 
         of the seating chart, demonstrating how it can be a helpful tool for the teacher.
