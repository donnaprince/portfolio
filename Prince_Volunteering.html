    In addition to being in the work field, I am also an avid volunteer, at
    various school and community events. As of now, I have completed over 
    30 hours of volunteering, and am ecstatic to continue this journey. 
    Aforementioned, I enjoy working with young kids, which has led me to 
    volunteer at my local elementary school, John Green Elementary School.
    Some of the events that I have coordinated include Sadia Science Fair Night,
    Family Art Night and John Green 10th Anniversary and Multicultural Fair. 
    Through these opportunities, I have been able to collaborate with many parents,
    who lead the volunteering at the school and provide my effort to create
    fun-filled events. In addition, as a member of various clubs, I have done many
    fundraising, and publicizing events, to increase the club reach. Lastly,
    my latest volunteering expedition has to lead me to be a part of 
    <a href="https://www.lawrencehallofscience.org" target="_blank">The Lawrence Hall of Science</a>,
    volunteering team. Out of over 200 applicants, I was selected
    to be a volunteer for the upcoming summer, in the Ingenuity Challenges
    section of the hall. As a volunteer of this section, I will be expected 
    to foster an interest in STEM fields for our various visitors and engage 
    them in an iterative engineering design process.
