An influential speaker was Dan Cherrier, who discussed the various aspects of Civil 
Engineering. This speaker, outlined the importance of civil engineering, what to expect
in a civil engineering job and how to get your license to practice. The speaker provided 
us with his background, being a manager at various companies, along with having a
geotechnical engineering background. He also, explained in depth the difficulty of 
studying civil engineering, as it has 1 in 4 dropouts. He also explained, the five 
fields of civil engineering, construction, geotechnical, structural, transportation
and water resources. I had never known that civil engineering had these many subsections,
but this provided me with new knowledge. He also stressed the importance of getting your 
license to be engineering, as only licensed engineering can practice Civil, Mechanical 
or Electrical Engineering. He had also, revealed that this field was one that is the 
always in shortage, due to its challenging nature. Only through his presentation was 
I able to open my mind to the field of Civil Engineering. Prior to this, I also believed
that this path was way to hard, and too challenging. Sharing his experience working
in the field has allowed me to take into consideration, different engineering pathways
besides my current track of Computer Science. Overall, his influential presentation,
allowed me to learn the various tracks in Civil Engineering and the importance of 
getting a license for some engineering sectors.
