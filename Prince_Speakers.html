An influential speaker was Mr.Dan Cherrier, who discussed the various aspects of Civil 
Engineering. This speaker, outlined the importance of civil engineering, what to expect
in a civil engineering job and how to get your license to practice. The speaker provided 
us with his background, being a manager at various companies, along with having a
geotechnical engineering background. He also, explained in depth the difficulty of 
studying civil engineering, as it has 1 in 4 dropouts. He also explained, the five 
fields of civil engineering, construction, geotechnical, structural, transportation
and water resources. I had never known that civil engineering had these many subsections,
but this provided me with new knowledge. He also stressed the importance of getting your 
license to be engineering, as only licensed engineering can practice Civil, Mechanical 
or Electrical Engineering. He had also, revealed that this field was one that is the 
always in shortage, due to its challenging nature. Only through his presentation was 
I able to open my mind to the field of Civil Engineering. Prior to this, I also believed
that this path was way to hard, and too challenging. Sharing his experience working
in the field has allowed me to take into consideration, different engineering pathways
besides my current track of Computer Science. Overall, his influential presentation,
allowed me to learn the various tracks in Civil Engineering and the importance of 
getting a license for some engineering sectors.

        An influential speaker was Aileen Iniguez, who discussed the various aspects of being 
        an analytics analyst. Iniguez mentioned how she was a newly graduated student from U.C 
        Berkeley and took part in a program called Techbridge Girls, which has led to her job at
         Chevron. She mentioned how she was able to network with her mentors at the program, that 
         introduced her to opportunities at Chevron, allowing her to obtain this position. The 
         speaker was able to break down what a data scientist does, which is using math and science 
         to manipulate data into an easier format. She then proceeded to outline her daily routine
          at Chevron, which was classified as technically oriented days and business-oriented days.
           On the business-oriented days, she partakes in daily stand-ups, interacts with business 
           users and frames business questions. On the other hand, on technical days she has a daily 
           stand up, wrangles data, codes, analyzes the data output with math and statistics, and 
           frames analytics questions. She also mentioned how the atmosphere at Chevron, was a 
           wonderful one as she was able to create many good experiences with her co-workers. She 
           also mentioned that as a newly graduated student, she was given mentors at Chevron to learn
            more about how the company runs, and more about their specific standards. Sharing her experience
             working in the field has opened my eyes to the importance of networking as she was able to get
              to this current position, by maintaining in touch with her mentors. Overall, her presentation 
              allowed me to learn more about data science as I have been interested in going to this pathway 
              but did not know much about what data analysts do.
