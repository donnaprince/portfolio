      This project was the last project of the first semester, which made us utilize, 
      the various skills, we gained throughout the first months, regarding mechanical 
      and electrical engineering. The main objective of this project was to ensure a 
      vehicle given certain constraints, can run on, one hydrogen cell, and/or two 
      hydrogen cells, or one solar cell, and/or two solar cells, with the greatest 
      speed and efficiency. The client for the vehicle was the renowned car company 
      Tesla, who needed assistance, in choosing a new clean, power supply, that will 
      benefit the company. The documentation for this project was done on a 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOxAtZDLFC72dpDzVWvTN3diqJEmyyw5Cur1ZKtSmpQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Document</a>
      , which consisted, the Design Brief, Decision Matrix, Annotated Pictures, 
      Modifications, Calculation/Measurements and Recommendation to the company, Tesla. 
      This project, was a collaboration between my peers, Taneesha Negi, Sameer Paila, 
      and Shreejith Ravishankar.  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoS10zwAVfH08fkNRYXdbjZ8DlVREHVkYLtZcd7hT14/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>,
      used for this project mainly focused on 
      documentation, individual deliverables, teamwork, and the solution performance
      of the vehicle. In order to plan out, the necessary tasks that need to complete
      each day, we used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UiNAe4IgjAFYaT7d-gyvkZKIPbd6s6IcREkH6DnjdgU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>, to create a Gantt Chart. An aspect, that I 
      contributed to this project in regards to the documentation, was writing the
      description of all the modifications we made and doing all the calculations 
      such as speed, electrical power, mechanical power and efficiency for the various 
      combinations of power sources. In terms of building the vehicle, I assisted tightening the various cells, to the vehicle, and did the breadboarding in order for the vehicle to run. One skill acquired from the project was how to
      be persistent, as our team had difficulties, creating a car that met all the 
      constraints, resulting us in creating multiple car prototypes. Another strength, 
      which I was able to garner was learning the science behing powering hydrogen cells, using a power station, and using a UV lamp for the solar cells to run. Through this project, our team was able to produce a 
      well-developed vehicle and recommended the solar source powered in parallel to Tesla, as it was the fastest.
      Above, are few photos that reveal the different
      configurations, the vehicle was able to run on.

     This was the first project in which a physical product was not created, but rather a prototype was
     formulated to represent a two-lane highway. The main intention of this project was to create a highway,
     on the software West Point Bridge. To be given to the client, American Bridge Company, that had been contracted
     to construct a bridge crossing part of the Trinity River. The documentation for this project was done on a
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ICzymDa2Y5Kh1ovTPYBAxbqAgsNvEuPClXm7SIrRRLY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Document</a>,
    which consisted, of a Design Brief, Decision Matrix, Research Summary, Brainstorming Ideas,
     Design Modifications, Final Solution Concept Pictorial, and a Final Solution Concept Written Communication. 
     The decision matrix was created on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JrWiSIXBLHb8rwO3yK4s4yq8-eLFfLy33ecAXsBssw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheet</a>, 
     in which the four prototypes created were compared with 
     one another, using point distribution rubric. This project was a collaboration with my peer, Artemis DelRusso. 
     The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y77xEhIDLaTjrIzbuMANr_fwWnfzhuHkqTbH0t_z-jE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>, 
     used for this project mainly focused on documentation, individual deliverables, teamwork, and the 
     solution performance of the bridge (amount of movement the bridge had, under the load). The main 
     <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FSYIS3kK-nKK5LZSFR3VNSgS8oW61UEr4Ibqhi850mI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">constraint</a>
     that we faced in this project, was not being able to cross the budget of $300,000, but we were able to spend
     $298,000, allowing the budget to be used to a full extent. To be cost-effective we used the cheapest material, 
     carbon steel on the Hinge Arch-Warren truss template. The concept of engineering applied to this project was,
     how to ensure the bridge would undergo the least amount of tension (blue colored members) and compression 
     (red colored members). In order to do this,  members that did not undergo any pressure was then reduced in 
     size, while members that had tension/compression were increased in size, thus reducing their tension/compression. 
     An aspect, that I contributed to this project in regards to the documentation, was writing the design brief, 
     decision matrix paragraph, annotating our final solution prototypes. In terms of creating a bridge prototype,
     I created two prototypes that performed well under the tension and compression the bridge underwent, as a result
     of the truck crossing the bridge.  One skill acquired from the project was how to collaborate with my team
     member outside of school, and dividing the work equally, as most of the work was done outside of the class.
     In addition, we also able to improve our presentation skill, as we presented in front of an audience, and answered 
     their questions, about our bridge. Through this project, our team was able to produce a bridge, that had very 
     little movement indicating the ability of the bridge to withstand the heavy load. Above, is a video that 
     demonstrates, the high quality of our two-lane highway.
