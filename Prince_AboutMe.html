                 Welcome to this online Engineering Portfolio. Here you will get to know more about,
                 me Donna Prince, a Junior at Dublin High School. I am currently taking the AP Computer Science Applications course
                  offered at Dublin High, as it serves as an interesting and unique 
                 option for me. Previously I have taken Computer Science and Engineering, as a Freshman and the Honors Principles of Engineering, as a Sophomore.
                 Along with this, I have decided to pursue the career path of 
                 becoming a Computer Software Engineering and graduate college with a Bachelor of Science in
                 Computer Science.  Currently, as a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, I am pursuing my engineering interests.
                 My budding interest in engineering has brought me to choose the career of Computer Science Engineering.
                In addition, to enrich myself with more knowledge in the technological field, I have been 
                taking college courses, at a local community college. By taking the
                Computer Science Principles course, as a Freshman I have garnered the ability to learn various coding languages. 
                In addition, through my experience in the course
                Principles of Engineering, I have played a major role in manufacturing and documenting, in all the projects I have done. 
                With every project, my attention to detail has increased, allowing me to obtain expemplary results.
                Another factor, that plays a role in my aspiration 
                 of being an engineer includes the fact that my parents are both software engineers working at
                 Apple, a mainstream engineering company. With examples set by them, like them, I aspire to 
                 achieve a similar feat.      
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Some characteristics that I have that elevates my experience as an engineer is being organized, 
                 versatile and diligent. My organization skills are best amplified in large projects since I am 
                 able to manage my time well. Versatility and the skill of diligence have often allowed me to 
                 present a well-developed product which is unique from others. I am also a winner at my high school
                 (DHS) fair and county fair, under the category of Computer Science and Mathematics for my creation of an app, I4U:Helping the Blind, to assist blind members. So far 
                I have participated in the Bring Change to Mind (club), and Clean Up the Environment (club) activities and am a member of the California Federation Scholarship.
                 Some strengths that I have inquired through my extracurricular activities are being calm 
                 and persistent. One specific example, was when I first decided to take up an instrument(violin),
                 the initial stages were filled with struggle, though with my persistence I have advanced a lot.
                 I currently work at a Kumon Center in Dublin, correcting children's work, and helping students
                 understand math and reading. Along with my work experience, I have a lot of volunteering experience, which offers
                 me a pleasant aura, helping my community.    
                  <br>
