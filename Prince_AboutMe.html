                 Welcome to this online Engineering Portfolio. Here you will get to know more about,
                 Donna Prince, a sophomore at Dublin High School. She currently is taking the Principles of 
                 Engineering offered at Dublin High, as it serves as an interesting and unique 
                 option for her, and has previously taken Computer Science and Engineering.
                 She has decided to pursue the career path of 
                 becoming a Computer Software Engineering and graduate college with a Bachelor of Science in
                 Computer Science.  Currently, as a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, she is pursuing her engineering interests.
                 Though she is not a part of any competitive teams or clubs regarding engineering, her budding
                 interest in engineering has brought her to choose the career of Computer Science Engineering.
                In order to further her interest in Computer Science Engineering, she has taken three college courses, pertaining to the engineering realm.
                Another factor, that plays a role in her aspiration 
                 of being an engineer include the fact that her parents are both software engineers working at
                 Apple, a mainstream engineering company. With examples set by them, like them, she aspires to 
                 achieve a similar feat.      
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Some characteristics that she has that elevates her experience as an engineer is being organized, 
                 versatile and diligent. Her organization skills are best amplified in large projects since she is 
                 able to manage her time well. Versatility and the skill of diligence have often allowed to her to 
                 present a well-developed product which is unique from others. She is also a winner at her high school
                 (DHS) fair and county fair, under the category of Computer Science and Mathematics for her creation of an app, I4U:Helping the Blind, to assist blind members. So far 
                she has participated in the Bring Change to Mind (club), and Clean Up the Environment (club) activities and is a member of the California Federation Scholarship.
                 Some strengths that she has inquired through her extracurricular activities are being calm 
                 and persistent. One specific example, was when she first decided to take up an instrument(violin),
                 the initial stages were filled with struggle, though with her persistence she advanced a lot.
                 She currently works at a Kumon Center in Dublin, correcting children's work, and helping students
                 understand math and reading. Along with her work experience, she has has done lot of volunteering experience, which offers
                 her a pleasant aura, helping her community.
