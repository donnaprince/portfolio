                 Welcome to this online Engineering Portfolio. Here you will get to know more about,
                 Donna Prince, a freshman at Dublin High School. She currently taking the Computer Science
                 and Engineering Course offered at Dublin High, as it serves as an interesting and unique 
                 option for me. She has decided to pursue the career path of 
                 becoming a Computer Software Engineering and graduate college with a Bachelor of Science in
                 Computer Science. Though she is not a part of any competitive teams or clubs regarding engineering, her budding
                 interest in engineering has brought her to choose the career of Computer Science Engineering.
                 In the future, she hopes to engage herself in activities regarding engineering. Her first 
                 initiative to be a part of the engineering group, is taking Computer Science and Engineering
                 course offered at her high school. After the completion of this course, she plans to apply for 
                 the Engineering Academy. Ultimately, these works should take her to the goal of getting into
                 a college ranked highly in Engineering. Another factor, that plays a role in her aspiration 
                 of being an engineer include the fact that her parents are both software engineers working at
                 Apple and Oracle, two mainstream companies. With examples set by them, like them, she aspires to 
                 achieve a similar feat.      
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Some characteristics that she has that elevates her experience as an engineer is being organized, 
                 versatile and diligent. Her organization skills are best amplified in large projects since she is 
                 able to manage her time well. Versatility and the skill of diligence have often allowed to her to 
                 present a well-developed product which is unique from others. She is also a winner at her high school
                 (DHS) fair, under the category of Computer Science and Mathematics for her creation of an app for the blind.So far 
                She has participated in the Live Club activities and is a member of the California Federation Scholarship.
                 Some strengths that she has inquired through her extracurricular activities are being calm 
                 and persistent. One specific example, was when she first decided to take up an instrument(violin),
                 the initial stages were filled with struggle, though with her persistence she advanced a lot.
                 She has no work experience right now, but has a lot of volunteering experience, which offers
                 a similar aura of working.
