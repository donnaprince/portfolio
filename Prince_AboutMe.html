                 Welcome to this online Engineering Portfolio. Here you will get to know more about me,
                 Donna Prince, a freshman at Dublin High School. I am currently taking the Computer Science
                 and Engineering Course offered at Dublin High, as it serves as an interesting and unique 
                 option for me. I have decided to pursue the career path of 
                 becoming a Computer Software Engineering and graduate college with a Bachelor of Science in
                 Computer Science. Though I am not a part of any competitive or clubs regarding engineering, my budding
                 interest in engineering has brought me to choose the career of Computer Science Engineering.
                 In the future, I hope to engage myself in activities regarding engineering. My first 
                 initiative to be a part of the engineering group is taking Computer Science and Engineering
                 course offered at my high school. After the completion of this course, I plan to apply for 
                 the Engineering Academy. Ultimately, these works should take me to the goal of getting into
                 a college ranked highly in Engineering. Another factor, that plays a role in my aspiration 
                 of being an engineer include the fact that my parents are both software engineers working at
                 Apple and Oracle, two mainstream companies. With examples set by them, like them, I hope to 
                 achieve a similar feat.      
                  <br>
                  <br>
                 Some characteristics that I have that elevate my experience as an engineer is being organized, 
                 versatile and diligent. My organization skills are best amplified in large projects since I am 
                 able to manage my time well. Versatility and the skill of diligence have often allowed to me to 
                 present a well-developed product which is unique from others. Currently, I have no major 
                 accomplishments from my high school career, as it is my freshman year in high school. So far 
                 I have participated in the Live Club activities and will take part in more activities throughout
                 the year. Some strengths that I have inquired through extracurricular activities are being calm 
                 and persistent. One specific example, was when I first decided to take up an instrument(violin),
                 the initial stages were filled with struggle, though with persistence I have advanced a lot.
                 I have no work experience right now, but have had a few volunteering opportunities, which offers
                 a similar aura of working.     
                  <br>

                  Thank You, for taking the time to read my website. If you would like to know more about me
                  and my engineering work, continue to other sections of the website. Overall, this page gave
                  you more insight about myself, a budding engineer.
