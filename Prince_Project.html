             <p>This assignment was the first project of the school year, using the platform from Scratch.
             The overall objective of the project was to accumulate knowledge about variable roles and recieve 
             an overview of engineering. The main goal of the project, was to be able to
             create a game or story using Scratch. Our group chose to create a game titled Maze-Tastic!,
             as we believed it connected with a larger audience. We did not use actual coding, 
             but used coding blocks to develop our game. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5OexaiGa-qG5wn8Cj7F3rL2OWOXbTcQ_PVtZHqPBKI/edit?ts=5a0bcca9"> rubric </a>
             used for the project consisted majorly of how we used algorithms in the code. The project 
             was a collaboration of my peers Rishika T., Jacob S., and I. The brainstorming portion of 
             the project was done on a flowchart, to visualize the ideas. The documentation of our project
             was done on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyQ5QJjmsv_v0WHYTXoSSTxnXJIXrrNpt7iZzkq-niY/edit?ts=5a0bcb92"> Google Document</a> 
             named Maze-Tastic!, which consisted of our daily progress and planning. An aspect, that
             I contributed to this project was the documentation, as well as the commenting what 
             each portion of the code does. One skill assimilated from the project, was how to document
             all the information accurately and in an orderly fashion. Another strength, which I was 
             able to garner was using Scratch in different ways to code the same function. In the project,
             our team was able to produce a very a refined game due to our teamwork. The game is embedded on the right along with the game

             Enjoy going through all the levels of the game.</p>

        The overall objective of the project was to utilize all our knowledge 
        regarding manipulating images and the language of python. The main 
        aspect of this project was to manipulate an image, of our choice for a 
        variety of clients. The client that we chose was <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlXBzQz64ZWUNK_3vkBotgEa_CeFR6V7B023UbCEmT0/edit?usp=sharing> client</a>  number one, which
        was to manipulate the images of our choice, for a cause. The <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwQUBg2WmhTIJFhsbtWyqfV0IQwKsJo0H7dcr6DjzUQ/edit?usp=sharing> rubric </a> for this
        project was similar to previous coding assignment focusing on the algorithms
        we used and teamwork. Using Python we where able to create functions, to allow
        the client choose the color of the border, as they wanted to be creatively active.
        The cause we decided to convey was the caging of animals in zoos. To emphasize 
        this injustice to the animals, we manipulated the images, by changing the colors
        of certain sections, added a border to the image,provided a short caption, 
        to capture our stance on this cause, and masked an image of bars on top of the image. This project was a collaboration along with 
        my peer Yoga Kanneboina.The documentation of our project was done on a 
        <a href= https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTXmA10Eu5D2_Go1qnFL9XFE2RH02QWZzwALk5N-XXU/edit?usp=sharing> Google Document</a>
         named Behind Bars!, which consisted of our daily progress and brainstorming.
        An aspect, that I contributed to this project was the documentation, 
        commenting on code, and coding for different manipulations. One skill, 
        that I accumulated from the project was how to code in an orderly fashion
        and understand the differences between NumPy and PIL. Another strength, 
        which I was able to garner in Python was also being able to understand 
        different file paths and the different image extensions such as .jpg or
        .png. Above, is the slideshow consisting of all the images before and after
        being manipulated.

      This project was the last project of the first semester, which made us utilize, 
      the various skills, we gained throughout the first months, regarding mechanical 
      and electrical engineering. The main objective of this project was to ensure a 
      vehicle given certain constraints, can run on, one hydrogen cell, and/or two 
      hydrogen cells, or one solar cell, and/or two solar cells, with the greatest 
      speed and efficiency. The client for the vehicle was the renowned car company 
      Tesla, who needed assistance, in choosing a new clean, power supply, that will 
      benefit the company. The documentation for this project was done on a 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOxAtZDLFC72dpDzVWvTN3diqJEmyyw5Cur1ZKtSmpQ/edit?usp=sharing">Google Document</a>
      , which consisted, the Design Brief, Decision Matrix, Annotated Pictures, 
      Modifications, Calculation/Measurements and Recommendation to the company, Tesla. 
      This project, was a collaboration between my peers, Taneesha Negi, Sameer Paila, 
      and Shreejith Ravishankar.  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VoS10zwAVfH08fkNRYXdbjZ8DlVREHVkYLtZcd7hT14/edit?usp=sharing"
>rubric</a>, used for this project mainly focused on 
      documentation, individual deliverables, teamwork, and the solution performance
      of the vehicle. In order to plan out, the necessary tasks that need to complete
      each day, we used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UiNAe4IgjAFYaT7d-gyvkZKIPbd6s6IcREkH6DnjdgU/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a>, to create a Gantt Chart. An aspect, that I 
      contributed to this project in regards to the documentation, was writing the
      description of all the modifications we made and doing all the calculations 
      such as speed, electrical power, mechanical power and efficiency for the various 
      combinations of power sources. In terms of building the vehicle, I assisted tightening the various cells, to the vehicle, and did the breadboarding in order for the vehicle to run. One skill acquired from the project was how to
      be persistent, as our team had difficulties, creating a car that met all the 
      constraints, resulting us in creating multiple car prototypes. Another strength, 
      which I was able to garner was learning the science behing powering hydrogen cells, using a power station, and using a UV lamp for the solar cells to run. Through this project, our team was able to produce a 
      well-developed vehicle and recommended the solar source powered in parallel to Tesla, as it was the fastest.
      Above, are few photos that reveal the different
      configurations, the vehicle was able to run on.
