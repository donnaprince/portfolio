             <p>This assignment was the first project of the school year, using the platform from Scratch.
             The overall objective of the project was to accumulate knowledge about variable roles and recieve 
             an overview of engineering. The main goal of the project, was to be able to
             create a game or story using Scratch. Our group chose to create a game titled Maze-Tastic!,
             as we believed it connected with a larger audience. We did not use actual coding, 
             but used coding blocks to develop our game. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5OexaiGa-qG5wn8Cj7F3rL2OWOXbTcQ_PVtZHqPBKI/edit?ts=5a0bcca9"> rubric </a>
             used for the project consisted majorly of how we used algorithms in the code. The project 
             was a collaboration of my peers Rishika T., Jacob S., and I. The brainstorming portion of 
             the project was done on a flowchart, to visualize the ideas. The documentation of our project
             was done on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyQ5QJjmsv_v0WHYTXoSSTxnXJIXrrNpt7iZzkq-niY/edit?ts=5a0bcb92"> Google Document</a> 
             named Maze-Tastic!, which consisted of our daily progress and planning. An aspect, that
             I contributed to this project was the documentation, as well as the commenting what 
             each portion of the code does. One skill assimilated from the project, was how to document
             all the information accurately and in an orderly fashion. Another strength, which I was 
             able to garner was using Scratch in different ways to code the same function. In the project,
             our team was able to produce a very a refined game due to our teamwork. The game is embedded on the right along with the game

             Enjoy going through all the levels of the game.</p>
