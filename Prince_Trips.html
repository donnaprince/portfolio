A noteworthy field trip that I have gone to was to the 
  <a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org" target="_blank">Computer Science History Museum</a>.
 Having gone to Stanford University, a handful 
of times to see the campus and for events, it was a pleasure getting an in-depth 
tour from a student who resides there. During the tour, we were 
exposed to the various buildings on campus and many of the Stanford traditions. 
In addition, I was also able to experience how the campus functions, on a day when
school in session. After, enjoying lunch at the campus, we headed to the Computer
Science History Museum. Here, we were able to see: the revolution of the first 
2000 years of computing, various technological devices, and their progression.
We were also able to see the IBM 1401 Data Processing System, which transformed 
data processing. Here we were able to use a rubric, showing us how data was stored 
and was able to punch it into a paper. Lastly, we also got a glimpse into the future, 
with their display of an autonomous car, and how they work. Overall, this full-day 
field trip, allowed me to experience the campus vibe in Stanford, and also learn
about the progression of technology.

        A memorable field trip that I have gone to was National Ignition Facility (NIF) 
       at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
    <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/what-is-nif  target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>.
    Before visiting the facility, I had the pleasure of listening to various speakers who engineered 
    various parts of the project, or those whose work revolves around the laser. Once we were 
    given our IDs to get access to NIF, we were greeted by a tour guide who provided us more 
    insight into the general history of the facility. To provide some background on NIF, it 
    is the largest and most powerful laser ever built. To quantify some aspects of NIF, it 
    has 40,000 optics and 192 laser beams that try to fuse on a target the size of a mustard
     seed. The NIF building took many years to complete, given its intricate design and 
     large quantities of material to be made. NIF took over a decade to make spanning 
     the width of three football fields, standing 10 stories tall and needing more than 
     55,000 cubic meters of concrete to la down as the base. The primary objective of this facility 
     is to create fusion, a phenomenon that only occurs on the Sun as of now. Currently, 
     the facility has been able to create fusion lasting only a fraction of a second. In the tour, 
     we were able to see the multiple laser beams that travel through the facility, in a square shape. 
     We also were able to see the various types of optics used for the construction of the facility, 
     ranging from shades of pink to blue. The guide also talked about NIF being one of the most dangerous 
     places to work, given the energy generated by the shots, but also one of the safest places to work, 
     as it has multiple safety measures in place.
