A noteworthy field trip that I have gone to was to the 
  <a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org" target="_blank">Computer Science History Museum</a>.
 Having gone to Stanford University, a handful 
of times to see the campus and for events, it was a pleasure getting an in-depth 
tour from a student who resides there. During the tour, we were 
exposed to the various buildings on campus and many of the Stanford traditions. 
In addition, I was also able to experience how the campus functions, on a day when
school in session. After, enjoying lunch at the campus, we headed to the Computer
Science History Museum. Here, we were able to see: the revolution of the first 
2000 years of computing, various technological devices, and their progression.
We were also able to see the IBM 1401 Data Processing System, which transformed 
data processing. Here we were able to use a rubric, showing us how data was stored 
and was able to punch it into a paper. Lastly, we also got a glimpse into the future, 
with their display of an autonomous car, and how they work. Overall, this full-day 
field trip, allowed me to experience the campus vibe in Stanford, and also learn
about the progression of technology.
